- Generative AI and ChatGPT in School Children’s Education: Evidence from a School Lesson
  + The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8–14 years old, studying in the 4th–6th grades across four classes in two schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5, as one example of generative AI, to personify learning material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. A clear majority of pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI-modified material.

- Can Chat GPT Replace the Role of the Teacher in the Classroom: A Fundamental Analysis
  +  This study will conduct an in-depth analysis of ChatGPT's ability to replace the role of teachers in the classroom learning process. This research is qualitative in nature. The methodology used to collect data includes attentive listening and careful documentation of relevant information, which is then subjected to analytical procedures such as data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The study arrived at the conclusion that in the context of using ChatGPT in learning, it should be noted that technology can only be a tool and cannot replace the role of the teacher entirely.

- ChatGPT in the Classroom: A Preliminary Exploration on the Feasibility of Adapting ChatGPT to Support Children’s Information Discovery
  + The influence of ChatGPT and similar models on education is being increasingly discussed. With the current level of enthusiasm among users, ChatGPT is envisioned as having great potential. As generative models are unpredictable in terms of producing biased, harmful, and unsafe content, we argue that they should be comprehensively tested for more vulnerable groups, such as children, to understand what role they can play and what training and supervision are necessary. Here, we present the results of a preliminary exploration aiming to understand whether ChatGPT can adapt to support children in completing information discovery tasks in the education context. We analyze ChatGPT responses to search prompts related to the 4th grade classroom curriculum using a variety of lenses (e.g., readability and language) to identify open challenges and limitations that must be addressed by interdisciplinary communities.

- The use of ChatGPT as a learning tool to improve foreign language writing in a multilingual and multicultural classroom
  +  In this context, the study aimed to examine the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a feedback tool on foreign language writing, especially for socially vulnerable populations, such as refugees/migrants, who face extra language difficulties. The study was conducted in a Junior High School (Gymnasium) classroom in an urban city in south Greece, which consisted of 8 students with a migrant/refugee background aged 15 years old who were attending German as a foreign language learning.
