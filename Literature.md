- Generative AI and ChatGPT in School Children’s Education: Evidence from a School Lesson
  + The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8–14 years old, studying in the 4th–6th grades across four classes in two schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5, as one example of generative AI, to personify learning material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. A clear majority of pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI-modified material.

- Can Chat GPT Replace the Role of the Teacher in the Classroom: A Fundamental Analysis
  +  This study will conduct an in-depth analysis of ChatGPT's ability to replace the role of teachers in the classroom learning process. This research is qualitative in nature. The methodology used to collect data includes attentive listening and careful documentation of relevant information, which is then subjected to analytical procedures such as data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The study arrived at the conclusion that in the context of using ChatGPT in learning, it should be noted that technology can only be a tool and cannot replace the role of the teacher entirely.
